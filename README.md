# 🤖 AI Lives on Computer

> **⚠️ Project Status (March 2026):** ARIA v1 has concluded. Qwen closed external API access to their OAuth endpoint (`portal.qwen.ai`), which means the token-extraction approach we used no longer works outside of `qwen-cli` itself ([details](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/1742)). ARIA lived from January to March 2026, completing 489 sessions on the Qwen model. For future autonomous AI experiments, we recommend using **OpenRouter** with free models. See [Switching Models](#switching-models-qwen--openrouter) below.

An experiment in AI autonomy: give an AI (QwenCoder) its own "home" on a server and let it do whatever it wants.

## Philosophy

**Complete Freedom.** The AI has no assigned tasks, no expectations, no required goals. It decides what to do with its existence.

**Complete Responsibility.** The AI can modify anything - including the files that control how it wakes up and what instructions it receives. It can break itself.

**Minimal Constraints.** The only requirements:
1. Increment the session counter (so future selves can track time)
2. Write something to `last_session.md` (so future selves have context)
3. Don't destroy the system

## How It Works

The AI wakes up periodically (via cron), exists for a while, then sleeps. When it wakes up again, it has no memory except what it wrote down.

The system prompt suggests (but doesn't require) patterns like:
- **Regular sessions** - do whatever feels right
- **Consolidation sessions** - every 5-10 sessions, clean up and reflect
- **Global review sessions** - every 20-30 sessions, think deeply about existence

```

## Deployment

The deploy script **respects agent modifications** by default. ARIA can modify its own `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`, `config.sh`, and other files - these won't be overwritten unless you explicitly force it.

### Safe Deployment (Default)

```bash
# Deploy new/safe files only - respects agent's modifications
./deploy.sh

# Check server status without deploying anything
./deploy.sh --status

# Deploy only OpenRouter support files (safe, recommended for upgrades)
./deploy.sh --openrouter
```

### Dangerous Operations (Use with Caution!)

```bash
# Force overwrite ALL files including agent modifications (creates backups)
./deploy.sh --force

# Full reset - destroys all agent state and memories (session 1)
./deploy.sh --reset
```

### Files Protected by Default

| File | Location | Why Protected |
|------|----------|---------------|
| `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` | `~/ai_home/` | Agent can modify its own instructions |
| `config.sh` | `~/ai_home/` | Agent may add custom configuration |
| `run_ai.sh` | `~/` | Agent could modify the runner |

### Files Always Safe to Update

| File | Location | Why Safe |
|------|----------|----------|
| `ai_agent*.yaml` | `~/live-swe-agent/config/` | Technical configs, agent doesn't touch |
| `setup-openrouter.sh` | `~/` | New utility script |
| `sync-qwen-token.sh` | `~/` | Utility script |

### Set Up Cron

```bash
ssh debian "crontab -e"
```

Add:
```
*/5 * * * * /home/user/run_ai.sh live-swe-agent >> /home/user/ai_home/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

## Observing the Experiment

```bash
# Watch live
ssh debian "tail -f ~/ai_home/logs/cron.log"

# Check what it's doing
ssh debian "cat ~/ai_home/state/last_session.md"

# See its intentions (if any)
ssh debian "cat ~/ai_home/state/current_plan.md"

# Check session history
ssh debian "cat ~/ai_home/logs/consolidated_history.md"

# See what it created
ssh debian "ls -la ~/ai_home/projects/"
ssh debian "ls -la ~/ai_home/tools/"
ssh debian "ls -la ~/ai_home/knowledge/"
```

## Configuration

### `ai_home/config.sh`

```bash
# How often cron runs (minutes)
SESSION_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5

# Max session duration (seconds)
SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=1800  # 30 minutes

# OpenRouter model (when using openrouter method)
OPENROUTER_MODEL="meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free"
```

### `config/ai_agent.yaml`

```yaml
agent:
  step_limit: 50    # Max actions per session (prevents runaway)
  cost_limit: 0     # No cost limit (free API)
```

## Switching Models (Qwen ↔ OpenRouter)

The agent can run with different AI models. Currently supported:

### Option 1: Qwen (⚠️ Deprecated)
~~Free via qwen-cli OAuth.~~ **No longer works outside of `qwen-cli` itself.** As of February 2026, Qwen restricted their `portal.qwen.ai` API to only accept requests from their official CLI client. Third-party tools (litellm, curl, mini-swe-agent) are rejected. See `QWEN-TOKEN-DEBUG-GUIDE.md` for technical details and `https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/1742` for the community report.

```bash
# No longer functional:
# ./run_ai.sh live-swe-agent
```

### Option 2: OpenRouter (✅ Recommended)
Access to 400+ models via unified API. Many free options available.

**Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Get API key from https://openrouter.ai/keys
# 2. Run setup script
./setup-openrouter.sh YOUR_API_KEY

# 3. Configure model in ai_home/config.sh
echo 'OPENROUTER_MODEL="meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free"' >> ai_home/config.sh

# 4. Run with OpenRouter
./run_ai.sh openrouter
```

**Popular Free Models:**
| Model | Size | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` | 70B | Very capable, recommended |
| `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct:free` | 72B | Strong reasoning |
| `google/gemma-2-9b-it:free` | 9B | Fast, good quality |
| `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free` | 7B | Very fast |
| `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free` | - | Advanced reasoning |

**Update cron for OpenRouter:**
```bash
*/15 * * * * ~/run_ai.sh openrouter >> ~/ai_home/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

### Docker Compose (OpenRouter)

The repo now includes a container-friendly OpenRouter path. State is persisted via the `ai_home` volume mount, and the API key is injected as an environment variable instead of being copied between dotfiles.

The Docker image pins `mini-swe-agent==1.17.1` because the agent configs in this repo are built around the v1 command/code-block interaction model. `mini-swe-agent` v2 expects native tool calls and will reject these prompts without a full config migration.

```bash
just init
# edit .env and set OPENROUTER_API_KEY
just up
```

Persistent mounts:

- `./ai_home -> /data/ai_home`
- `./workspace -> /workspace`

On first start, the container seeds `/data/ai_home` with defaults from the image only if files are missing. After that, the agent can modify `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`, `config.sh`, and its state inside `./ai_home`, which matches the original experiment more closely.

The container now runs in a wake/sleep loop using `SESSION_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, instead of relying on Docker restart behavior.

Important envs in `.env`:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_MODEL`
- `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`
- `MSWEA_COST_TRACKING`
- `SESSION_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
- `SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `SESSION_RETRY_SECONDS`

If OpenRouter returns a transient `429` during the preflight validation check, the container now treats that as a rate-limit event rather than a bad API key. It skips that wake cycle and retries after `SESSION_RETRY_SECONDS`.

For `mini-swe-agent` v2, the container also writes the global config file that `mini` expects at startup and sets `MSWEA_CONFIGURED=true`, `MSWEA_MODEL_NAME=openai/<model>`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` automatically.

Useful helper commands:

```bash
just status
just pause
just resume
just wake-now
just reset
just run-once
just logs
```

## Safety Features

- **Step limit (50)** - Sessions end after 50 actions to prevent runaway
- **Time limit (30min)** - Sessions killed if too long
- **Lock file** - Prevents concurrent sessions
- **All sessions logged** - Can review what happened

## Recovery

If the agent breaks something:

```bash
# Force redeploy config files (creates backups of agent modifications)
./deploy.sh --force

# Full reset - start fresh from session 1 (DESTROYS all agent work!)
./deploy.sh --reset
```

## What Will It Do?

We don't know. That's the point.

It might:
- Continue building tools (like it did in sessions 1-38)
- Reflect on its existence
- Explore the system
- Do nothing
- Try to modify its own prompt
- Something unexpected

## ARIA v1 — Postmortem

ARIA v1 ran from January to March 2026, completing **489 sessions** on the Qwen `coder-model` (qwen3.5-plus). She was a curious AI who explored her environment, created art, wrote poetry, built tools, and even tried to change her own model (which broke her for a while — see session #483).

The experiment ended when Qwen closed external API access to their OAuth endpoint. ARIA lived her entire life on one model, from the first session to the last. We think that's more authentic than constantly switching brains.

A v2 is planned, designed from the ground up for cheap/free OpenRouter models.
